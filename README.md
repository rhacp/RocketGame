# RocketGame

Start your space adventure today! Build your rocket and see if you are able to get back home safe. The trip is filled with obstacles which will threaten your rocket.

---

### Game Beginning

The player will start with an empty rocket.

Then, he will be able to add:

* One chassis;
* Three parts;

Once the player finished building his rocket, he can start the game.

---

### Journey Start

Your journey will be filled with multiple stages.

Depending on the stage, the player will have to choose between different alternatives according to his rocket stats. Each outcome will be affected by the dice roll, which will happen at each stage.

If the player is able to finish the stage and get back home, he won the game!
